# NYC Parking Violations dbt Project

## Project Description

This dbt project processes and models NYC parking violation datasets to create a clean, reliable, and analyzable data warehouse. It includes multiple layers of transformation â€” Bronze (raw data), Silver (cleaned and enriched data), and Gold (aggregated metrics and business insights).

The project leverages DuckDB as the data warehouse backend and dbt for transformation, testing, and documentation. It includes seed files for reference data like parking violation codes and sample data extracts for development and testing.
